## Configuration model

> **Accepted** — A deployment configuration has three distinct layers:
>
> 1. **Character** — the persistent person, innate movement identity, narrative identity, and equipment compatibility.
> 2. **Specialization** — one of three Hub-selected play styles for that character.
> 3. **Overdrive** — a temporary in-Mission transformation unique to the selected Specialization.

Each of the four characters has three Specializations, creating twelve selectable play styles without turning the crew into twelve separate characters.

## Specializations

> **Accepted** — The baseline configuration is one of each character's three Specializations. It is the character's default Specialization when that character becomes available; the other two are unlocked through campaign play.

Selecting a Specialization changes the character for the entire Mission. A Specialization defines:

- base statistics;
- normal skills and skill behavior;
- weapon classes;
- armour classes;
- movement modifiers within the character's broader movement identity;
- strengths, liabilities, and tactical priorities;
- its unique Overdrive.

A Specialization is not merely a choice of future Overdrive. The twelve Specializations must remain materially different during ordinary play.

The eight non-default Specializations unlock through Specialization Imprints hidden in Act II optional routes. Their exact Mission and route assignments remain unresolved.

## Coffin selection

> **TODO — Selection flow:** Diagram station activation, unlocked Coffin choices, rail swap, Hub testing, and deployment.

> **Accepted** — Each Specialization has a Recovery Capsule variant, called a “Coffin” by the crew. All variants share one standardized coffin-like shell and pneumatic opening; Character and Specialization are communicated through the central emblem, decoration, and controlled color treatment. One of the Character's three variants occupies their assigned Hub docking station at a time. Changing Specialization physically swaps the docked Coffin by rail.

The interface initially exposes only the baseline Specialization and no named locked slots or `1/3` counter. The illuminated Character emblem identifies all three Coffin variants; adjacent decorative elements gain color as additional Specializations unlock. Unlocking the first additional Specialization makes the physical pattern legible and expands station activation to offer the available variants.

## Equipment boundary

> **Accepted** — Equipment belongs to the shared [[Equipment/Overview|crew stash]], while Specializations determine weapon and armour compatibility.

Equipment can meaningfully alter a compatible kit without replacing its play style. For example, a heavy-weapon Specialization might accept conventional, multi-barrel, laser, or explosive heavy weapons while retaining its defining commitment, force, and mobility liabilities.

## Initial concealment and unlock

> **Accepted** — A new player is not told that Overdrive exists. Characters initially use their available Specializations without access to Overdrive.

Overdrive is first revealed and unlocked for the entire crew by completing [[Missions/M05|The Four Trials]]. It is one global campaign unlock, not a separate progression track for every character.

During that Mission:

- [[Characters/Relay|RELAY]] is the primary deployed Character;
- the facility branches into character-specific activation rooms that the player may approach in any order;
- the Systems Specialist becomes immobile while operating each room;
- control transfers temporarily to the relevant crew member;
- that crew member completes a focused scenario with unlimited Overdrive;
- the scenario teaches how that character's default Specialization transforms;
- control then returns to the Systems Specialist.

Completing the Mission unlocks Overdrive for the crew. Every Specialization acquired after this reveal includes its own Overdrive by default. A Specialization acquired before the reveal gains its Overdrive when the global system is unlocked.

The Four Trials is a scripted exception to the ordinary one-character-per-deployment rule. It does not establish free character switching or companion AI as general mechanics.

## Overdrive behavior

> **Accepted** — Overdrive temporarily exaggerates or inverts the selected Specialization instead of merely increasing damage.

Each Overdrive should materially change at least three of the following:

1. movement;
2. preferred combat position;
3. target priority;
4. optional route opportunities;
5. tolerated risk;
6. what the transformation reveals about character identity.

> **Open question** — Meter source, activation input, duration, cancellation, death behavior, audiovisual language, and exact transformation rules require later design and playtesting.

## Level-design contract

> **Accepted** — Every ordinary main Mission must be completable by every one of the twelve Specializations. Some configurations may make an Encounter easier or harder, but none may make main-path completion impossible.

Ordinary Mission completion must never require a charged Overdrive meter. Levels and Missions require compatibility testing against all twelve Specializations.

Optional and explicitly advertised content may require a particular Character, Specialization, compatible item, or Overdrive. These exceptions may include:

- character events;
- Alert Missions;
- Special Missions;
- side quests;
- secret rooms or Missions;
- equipment and Specialization unlock challenges.

A requirement must gate an intentional optional or special-purpose reward, not silently invalidate a normal deployment choice.
